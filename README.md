This program takes an input of 10 files containing the following format:
  @ARTICLE{

  Afterwards, the program then create 3 different styles bibliographies (IEE, ACM, NJ) for each article and place them in seperate text files, a text file for each different bibliography style
 
 A sample output for an ACM style look like this: 
  [1]     M. B. Khan et al. 2018. Image Processing and Analysis of Phase-Contrast Microscopic Images of Activated Sludge to Monitor the Wastewater Treatment Plants. IEEE Access. 6, 4 (2018), 1778-1791. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780249.
